## clock-todo app
https://njikim.github.io/JS-Practice/Clock_ToDo/ <br><br>
it contains.. <br>
- hello + yourname (it remembers you)
- todo list
- temperature based on your location

## paint_JS
if you click the btn 'Go to JS Paint!' on the top of the clock-todo page, you can see my second work there! :D <br>
- you can draw, fill in the canvas and save the image! 
- it's only web friendly and doesn't work well on mobile :'(
